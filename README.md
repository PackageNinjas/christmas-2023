# Pack Christmas Project 2023

This year, once again, we are happy to present the result of the SUSE Packaging Team's Christmas workshop.

We wanted to playfully adapt one of the most traditional Christmas songs "Jingle Bells" and celebrate packaging, bug-fixing, and open-source development.

We hope you enjoy our creative take on the traditional tune and perhaps find yourself singing along on Christmas Eve.

Happy holidays and have a lot of fun!


Your SUSE Packaging Team
